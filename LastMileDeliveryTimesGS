## Overview

This project analyzes last-mile delivery operations using Google Sheets to simulate lightweight BI dashboards for operational decision-making. The analysis focuses on delivery time, efficiency, and safety incident rates across driver experience levels, vehicle types, temperature conditions, and fulfillment channels.

## Tools Used

- Google Sheets (data cleaning, feature engineering, pivot tables, visualizations, dashboarding)

## Dataset Features

- Delivery Time
- Packages Delivered
- Distance to City Center
- Driver Experience Level
- Vehicle Type (Gas vs Electric)
- Fulfillment Channel
- Temperature
- Safety Incidents

## Feature Engineering

The following new fields were created for enhanced analysis:

- `delivery_efficiency` (packages/hour)
- `distance_efficiency` (miles/hour)
- `safety_incident_rate` (incidents/package)
- `experience_level` (banded)
- `temperature_band` (Cold / Moderate / Hot)
- Synthetic `trip_id` for unique trip identification

## Key Metrics

| KPI | Value |
|---|---|
| **Avg Delivery Time** | 5.77 hrs |
| **Avg Delivery Efficiency** | 19.82 pck/hr |
| **Avg Safety Incident Rate** | 0.049 inc/pck |

## Deliverables

- **Pivot Tables** for:
  - Delivery Time by Experience Level and Vehicle Type
  - Delivery Efficiency by Experience Level and Vehicle Type
  - Safety Incident Rate by Experience Level and Distance Efficiency Band
- **Charts**:
  - Delivery Time Distribution (Grouped Bar Chart)
  - Delivery Efficiency Distribution (Grouped Bar Chart)
  - Safety Incident Heatmap (Conditional Formatting)
- **Dashboard** combining KPIs, charts, and heatmap into a single operational reporting view inside Google Sheets

## Business Insights

- Delivery efficiency improves consistently with driver experience.
- Electric vehicles tend to perform slightly better under certain conditions.
- Safety incidents increase for new drivers, especially on higher distance efficiency routes.
- Temperature bands show minor but observable impacts on delivery times.
