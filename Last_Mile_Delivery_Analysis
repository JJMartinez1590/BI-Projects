[ðŸ‘‰ View Interactive Dashboard on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jose.martinez5381/viz/LastMileDeliveryPerformanceBIDashboard/Dashboard1)
## Overview

In this project, I analyzed last-mile delivery operations using a dataset containing delivery records enriched with operational variables. The goal was to uncover actionable insights for optimizing delivery efficiency and safety.

## Tools Used

- Google Sheets (Data Cleaning & Preparation)
- Tableau (Data Visualization & Dashboarding)

## Dataset Features

- Delivery Time
- Number of Packages Delivered
- Distance from City Center
- Driver Experience Level
- Safety Incidents
- Vehicle Type (Gas vs Electric)
- Fulfillment Channel (SFS vs SFDC)
- Temperature Bands (Cold, Moderate, Hot)

## Key Performance Metrics

- **Avg Delivery Time:** 5.8 hrs
- **Avg Delivery Efficiency:** 19.82 packages/hour
- **Avg Safety Incident Rate:** 0.049 incidents/package

## Business Insights

- Experienced drivers demonstrated higher delivery efficiency.
- Cold weather conditions led to slightly higher delivery times.
- Electric vehicles showed more stable performance across temperature bands.
- Higher safety incident rates were observed in longer-distance deliveries, especially for less experienced drivers.
- Fulfillment channel comparisons revealed performance variations between SFDC and SFS channels.

## Business Value

The interactive Tableau dashboards allow operational teams to:

- Identify driver segments for targeted training.
- Optimize routing based on experience and weather.
- Monitor safety incident trends.
- Compare fulfillment strategies for operational improvements.
