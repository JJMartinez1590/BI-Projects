# 📊 Walmart Store Sales Analysis (2010–2012)

This project explores weekly sales data across Walmart stores from 2010 to 2012 to identify trends, measure the impact of holidays, and assess economic factors influencing performance. Using Tableau, I developed interactive dashboards to help upper management make data-driven decisions across four key focus areas.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Identify top- and bottom-performing stores by weekly sales  
- Evaluate the impact of holidays on store-level sales lift  
- Analyze monthly seasonality and MoM % changes in sales  
- Assess correlation between sales and economic indicators (Fuel Price, Unemployment Rate, CPI)

## 📈 Dashboards Overview

### 1. **Executive Summary (Top-Level KPIs)**
> A high-level view of total sales, average store performance, and the contribution of holiday weeks. MoM trends highlight December as the strongest sales month with a 30.47% spike.

### 2. **Store Performance Dashboard**
> Compares weekly sales trends across top 5 and bottom 5 stores. Store 20 leads with over $301M in sales, while Store 33 lags at $37M. Highlights significant performance gaps and sales volatility.

### 3. **Economic Factors Impact**
> Examines the relationship between sales and economic variables. Findings show Walmart sales remained steady despite changes in fuel prices, unemployment rates, and CPI—demonstrating resilience to macroeconomic pressure.

### 4. **Holiday Sales Impact**
> Analyzes holiday-related sales lift by store and month. Average holiday sales lift was 7.84%, with Store 7 seeing the highest increase at 19.44%. November accounted for the largest holiday sales volume.
